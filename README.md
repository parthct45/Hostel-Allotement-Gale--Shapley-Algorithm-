# Hostel-Allotment-Gale-Shapley-Algorithm 
The Hostel Allotment project is an application that uses the Gale-Shapley algorithm to efficiently allocate hostel rooms to students based on their preferences and priorities. The algorithm ensures a stable matching where both students and rooms are assigned optimally, taking into account their preferences and constraints.In order to facilitate the above algorithm data structure used is Graphs .
